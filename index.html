    <h3>Why Scump Is The Best COD Player Of All Time</h3>
    <p>Seth “Scump” Abner has been the face of competitive Call of Duty since he started competing in Black Ops 1 as a high schooler. Scump is known for his charismatic personality and content creation, as well as his unmatched slaying ability.
<p>
        Scump is the best pure SMG player to ever play Call of Duty. His aggressive play style and perfect aim have allowed Scump to be the best slayer in Call of Duty history. His role on every team has been, go kill the other team and put pressure on them 24/7, and Scump does it to perfection.
        <p></p>

        Scump was a member of Optic Gaming from 2010 to 2019, the longest tenure for any Call of Duty pro with one team. As Optic became the most popular team in the league, Scump was at the forefront because he was the most popular player as well as a top 5 player in almost every single game.
        

        The Jetpack era of Call of Duty (2015-2017) was the peak of Scump’s career. Scump was widely regarded as the best player overall in Advanced Warfare, and a top 3 player in both Black Ops 3 and Infinite Warfare. The long wait for Scump’s world championship also ended in 2017, as he led Optic Gaming to the Infinite Warfare World Championship.
        

        As of right now, Scump is the captain of Chicago Huntsmen. It is still weird to see him playing for anyone besides Optic Gaming, but I will get used to it eventually. Scump is one of the leaders of the team as well as one of the better SMG players in the league as well. He is a major reason why Chicago is a top 3 team with chances at winning it all this year. </p>
